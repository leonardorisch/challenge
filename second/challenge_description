# ## Fibonacci Sequence
#
# This simple piece of code runs the [fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), and returns the fibonacci value at a given index.
#
# For example:
#
# ```python
# from main import fibonacci
#
# fibonacci(1) == 1
# fibonacci(2) == 2
# fibonacci(3) == 3
# fibonacci(4) == 5
# fibonacci(5) == 8
# ```
#
# ## Your task
#
# The current implementation has a bug that can crash the application, your job is to find it and fix it.
#
# ## Restrictions
#
# * You can assume that the `fibonacci` function will only ever receive `integers` as parameters, so there is no need to handle other types.
# * Otherwise, feel free to change the code in any way you wish.
 
def fibonacci(x):
    if not isinstance(x, int):
        return None  # Only accept integers
 
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return 1
 
    return fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2)
 
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print map(fibonacci, range(10))
